Isaac mod referencing Oreb and Zeeb

In Greek mythology, crows are seen as messengers of the Gods and are associated with prophecy and insight.
In biblical terms, crows are seen as both harbingers of good and evil.
They are God's providence and messengers of God’s judgment.
They taught Cain how to bury Abel, they have fed Elijah when he was at his lowest, but they have also been an omen directly associated with death.

Oreb is not one to be blessed. His people (the Midians) have brought tyrannical rule over Israel for 7 years.
God has brought Gideon to overthrow the Midians, group from the descendent of Abraham (father of Isaac).
Abandoned by God, he now tries to hide from his unaltered, unchanging fate, perhaps already having been through it.
The underground bids him a final resting place before they strike, but already his worries have caught up to him.
Will you guide Oreb to his fate, or will you sway the odds?
Will his **forsaken** nature be bearable, as the whole world goes against him?

**Luke 12:24**
<br>
Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them.
Of how much more value are you than the birds!

Adds 4 (not all directly playable) characters!

**Oreb**: (The Forsaken)
<br>
Crow heart could only imitate the deception this bird brings.
His health works entirely opposite, taking Red Hearts first but only losing Devil Deal chance upon taking Soul Heart damage.
He is more cursed than royal blood could offset however, his feathers can't hold collectibles that well and losing an Eternal Heart brings a stark reminder to his dire fate.
His soul is tainted, but the Devil seems to approve of it more than his battle worn royal body.

His forsaken path has made Angel Deals an impossibility, though even if he sways fate, it comes back to bite him.
His speed is now more focused on wings than walking, so gather more!
You're unable to resist riches and sparkles, so spend them like the royal you are before they pull you down to the ground!

**Tainted Oreb**: (The Marauder)
<br>
Fate has caught up with him, dying at the hands of Gideon's army.
He longer lives in fear, but does he live at all?
What is his existence, where is he, what is happening, why does his body feel so unstable?

Who cares!
Rob those who live in the underworld, bring chaos beyond the grave!
Steal all those others were buried with and sell it to the underworld empire!

The underworld brings many new challenges, items are harder to obtain for free, shops sell everything from all over the world with a much higher quality than before, souls are free to be stolen!
Devil deals are even easier to obtain if you can keep yourself together, which seems to be far more difficult in this realm.

*Through respawn/challenges:*
<br>
**Incarnate** (The Beast)
<br>
You ever thought to yourself, what would it be like to breathe fire?
Well, here's the answer, all in this one payment only package!
Just call 666-666-666 and get yours today!

I always wanted to make a character inspired by The Beast, and i'd say this unique firing mechanic really brought it out.
I've made sure to include every tear changing item to become something useful or unique.

*Through challenges:*
<br>
**Minä** (The Witch)
<br>
I don't speak Finnish, but i do know that this character finished me.
We've brought Isaac to Noita, but nobody's ever seem to have done the reverse.
So here it is!
Your very own nightmare!

Conquer the floors, craft spell combinations, choose perks, collect wands, buy spells, find the orbs, throw acid, drink lava, get eaten by gigantic worms, find the answer to everything, turn yourself into gold!
