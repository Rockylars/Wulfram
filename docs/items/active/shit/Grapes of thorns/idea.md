- Converts neutral/holy babies to [Cambion Conception](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cambion_Conception) babies.
- Is pretty shit in most cases, but can grant you a bunch of top tier babies if you do it right.
- Does nothing if there's nothing to convert.
- Has no limit on how many it can convert, unlike [Korban](/docs/items/active/good/Korban/idea.md) or [Sacrificial Altar](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar).
- Halves your health as a drawback.
