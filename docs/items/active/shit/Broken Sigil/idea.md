- Works like Crooked Penny, but for curses.
- Using it has a 50% chance to either remove all curses or to double them.
  - Doubling the curse uses different curses for each new one.
- Once you reach maximum curses, your next roll will instead have a 50% chance to instantly kill you or remove all curses.
