- Grants a chance for homing knowledge tears that instill slowness and confusion to the enemy.
  - They look like egyptian symbols, since a large part of this book is the [Instruction of Amenemope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_of_Amenemope).
  - Has a set 25% chance, using it again (somehow) doubles that chance.
- It's a bit crappy, but you need to add bad items to balance it out.
