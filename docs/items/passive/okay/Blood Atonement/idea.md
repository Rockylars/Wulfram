- Angel deals now allow you to pay for the items similar to devil deals.
- Each item only costs a single heart, no matter the type, but which one is taken is chosen by the code.
- Eternal hearts and golden hearts are taken as payment, taking priority.
- Grants a minimum 15% angel deal chance no matter if a devil deal was taken before this.
  - This gets ignored when you have [Eucharist](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Eucharist).
  - Even works when you have [Goat Head](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Goat_Head), reducing the devil deal chance to 85%.
- Will technically also grant a fixed 25% devil deal chance if duality is taken.
