- Angel deals now allow you to pay for the items similar to devil deals.
- Each item only costs a single heart, no matter the type, but which one is taken is chosen by the code.
  - Eternal hearts and golden hearts are also taken as payment, taking the highest priority.
  - Red hearts also have a higher chance of being taken.
- Grants a minimum 15% angel deal chance no matter if a devil deal was taken before this.
  - This gets ignored when you have [Eucharist](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Eucharist).
  - Even works when you have [Goat Head](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Goat_Head), reducing the devil deal chance to 85%.
  - Will work with [Duality](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Duality).
    - If you also have [Blessing of the damned](), the minimum chance is increased to 30%.
