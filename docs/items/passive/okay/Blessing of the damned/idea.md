- Reverse of [Blood Atonement](/docs/items/passive/okay/Blood%20Atonement/idea.md).
- Devil deal items become free but are now a choice item similar to angel deals.
  - [Judas' Tongue](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Judas'_Tongue) and [Blue Tongue](/docs/trinkets/Blue Tongue/idea.md) now give a 1 damage up instead.
  - [A Pound of Flesh](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/A_Pound_of_Flesh) will make ensure one pedestal can still be purchased with money rather than being a choice item.
- Grants a minimum 15% devil deal chance.
  - This gets ignored when you have [Goat Head](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Goat_Head).
  - Even works when you have [Eucharist](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Eucharist), reducing the angel deal chance to 85%.
  - Will work with [Duality](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Duality).
    - If you then also have [Blood Atonement](/docs/items/passive/okay/Blood%20Atonement/idea.md), the minimum chance is combined to 30%.
