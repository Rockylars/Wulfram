- Upon dying, you enter godmode.
  - You can't take any damage during it.
  - All enemies are permanently stunned.
  - Enemies will "disconnect" AKA vanish (with an explosion) from the room within 5-10 seconds.
  - Reaching the next floor will grant you a black heart (or red heart for characters that can't have red hearts)
    - If you don't reach the next floor within a minute, you will game over, even with revives.
