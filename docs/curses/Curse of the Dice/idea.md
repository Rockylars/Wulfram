**Name:** Curse of the Dice
<br>
**Icon:** Square dice

Taking damage will trigger both the [D12](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/D12) and the old effect of the [D10](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/D10).
This is similar to [Cracked Dice](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cracked_Dice) but has no D6 or D20 benefit and no D8 downside.
