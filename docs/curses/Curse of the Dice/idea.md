**Name:** Curse of the Dice
<br>
**Icon:** Square dice

This curse is very similar to [Cracked Dice](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cracked_Dice). For the whole floor, your stats are cast under a temporary [D8](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/D8) reroll but for all your stats, taking damage will reroll the temporary modifiers.
This **must** be temporary because this would otherwise be a run ender while it should be a simple curse.
Taking damage will also trigger both the [D12](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/D12) and the old effect of the [D10](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/D10) to reroll all tile-entities and enemies.
