**Name:** Curse of the Dice
<br>
**Icon:** Star shape

For the duration of the curse, you behave like **Tainted Eden**, gaining new items for your current set.
This curse will be super broken with other mods that take items off you in exchange.
You can not find active items for the current floor through the [NO!](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/NO!) trinket effect and your current active stays the same.
After the curse is over, you gain all your normal items back. This curse will not change your health.

Taking damage rerolls your temporary items.
