This beggar will take a bomb for a chance at spawning either:
- half a soul heart
- a bone heart
- normal wisp

For every fail you get a bone orbital.

Has a chance to drop a trinket from the specific trinket collection after 5 bombs.

Has a chance to spawn an item from the specific item collection after 15 bombs. 

The collection is focused on knife and some bomb related items/trinkets.

Will not take more than 30 bombs, however this does not guarantee an item payout as the health is already massively beneficial unless you're **Bethany**.

Killing it grants [Curse of Pica](/docs/curses/special/Curse%20of%20Pica/idea.md).
