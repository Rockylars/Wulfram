This beggar will never take more than 25 cents to given an item.
With the 14th cent and onwards, you get a 1/8th chance for an item from the [Collective Crow Beggar item pool](item_pool.md) to appear.

Bombing this beggar will give [Curse of the Corvid](/docs/curses/Curse%20of%20Corvus/idea.md) for the floor.

Once you run out of money, the crow will accept different shinies in the following order:
- Key = 3 pennies
- Rune = 5 pennies
- Soulstone = 10 pennies
- Unsmelted trinket from the collection = 7 pennies
- Active item from the collection (be careful) = instant item reward

The consumables are all taken even if they've already been given to you for a single cent, the bird is smart but not financially smart.
If you give an alternate, more valuable option than pennies while you only needed to give 1 (example) more penny, then the remainder will be returned in feather orbitals.
