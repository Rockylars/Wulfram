This beggar will take a full red heart with a loud cartoon "bonk" in return for triggering on hit effects once every second over the next 6 seconds.

Has a chance to leave after one use, will leave after being used twice, both could net you a really easy trinket or item.

Has a 10% chance to drop a trinket from the specific trinket collection upon leaving.

Has a 10% chance to spawn an item from the specific item collection upon leaving if no trinket was spawned.

The collection is focused on sacks related items/trinkets, though most aren't that good.
