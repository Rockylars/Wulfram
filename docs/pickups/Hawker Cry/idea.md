Spawns a random bird beggar representing one of the seven deadly sins, each with their own downside.

- Envy: [Jealous Jackdaw](/docs/objects/Jealous%20Jackdaw/idea.md), represents Pride and Greed in history/mythology, thus Envy.
- Gluttony: [Rotund Raven](/docs/objects/Rotund%20Raven/idea.md), they can eat anything and are rather large.
- Wrath: [Malicious Magpie](/docs/objects/Malicious%20Magpie/idea.md), is known to be thieving, observant, smart and most referenced out of all corvids as harbingers of death.
- Pride: [Pulchritudinous Piapiac](/docs/objects/Pulchritudinous%20Piapiac/idea.md), for its world central location and actual beauty, only one can spawn per floor for it is the only number one.
- Lust: [Noxious Nutcracker](/docs/objects/Noxious%20Nutcracker/idea.md), they store so many damn nuts and seeds, so therefor funny analogy.
- Greed: [Collective Crow](/docs/objects/Collective%20Crow/idea.md), long historical myth about them collecting anything and everything.
- Sloth: [Rotten Rook](/docs/objects/Rotten%20Rook/idea.md), known as the farmer's friend, they tend not to fly far from humans, also looks as if it's face has rotten away.

Considered a rune object in reference to the viking coin, or a coin of course.
