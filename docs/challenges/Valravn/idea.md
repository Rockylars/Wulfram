You start as **Oreb** with the following items:

- [Charm of the Vampire](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Charm_of_the_Vampire)
- [Placenta](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Placenta)
- [Empty Heart](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Empty_Heart)
- [Candy Heart](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Candy_Heart)
- [Hollow Heart](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Hollow_Heart)
- [Forsaken]()
- Smelted [Child's Heart](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Child%27s_Heart) trinket
- Smelted [Crow Heart](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Crow_Heart) trinket
- Smelted [Black Feather](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Feather) trinket (you will get devil deals as long as you don't damage your black hearts) 

You begin with 4 red heart containers and 2 black heart containers, but this will quickly turn into a mess of hearts.
You bleed like **Tainted Magdalene** though a lot faster, more similar to [Shard of Glass](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Shard_of_Glass).
The increased red heart drops and [Charm of the Vampire](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Charm_of_the_Vampire) slow it down actively and [Placenta](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Placenta) slows it down passively.
All your hearts will bleed, you constantly need fresh blood. Bleeding does not trigger on-hit effects.

You gain no items, relying solely on [Candy Heart](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Candy_Heart) for stats.
You turn into a wolf raven fusion whenever you take non-bleed damage, swiping wildly around.
You turn into a knight after dealing enough damage, similar to **Tainted Samson**'s rage, turning you to melee with a black sword but making you invulnerable for the duration.

The whole challenge is about consuming as many red hearts as possible and having to avoid black hearts, which probably has become a habit to you to pick up as soon as you see them.
Black hearts are detrimental to hold, as [Crow Heart](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Crow_Heart) will make it impossible to fully get rid of them and they take up max health slots.

Ends with a scary ending animation of the [Valravn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valravn) eating the heart out of Isaac and growing even stronger by gaining another set of wings.

Unlike [Have a Heart](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Have_a_Heart), you will keep losing health and thus want to find ways to heal faster.
Unlike [Bloody Mary](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Bloody_Mary), the stats you gain from healing are permanent rather than temporary per floor.
The strategy is to keep killing and keep healing as fast as possible to make it down floor after floor.
There are no shops to heal from and no items to save you, you can bank on devil deals but black hearts are not favorable.
