<br>
**Character:** Isaac

**Goal:** Spend 10000 coins and reach Home, this spawns the trophy on your position.

You start with:
- [Mark of the Beast]()
- [Vintage of Abiezer](/docs/items/passive/amazing/Vintage of Abiezer/idea.md)
- [Broken Modem](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Modem)
- [Restock](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Restock)
- [Chaos](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Chaos)

You use [Sampo](/docs/items/active/unobtainable/Sampo/idea.md) and die, then the "MISTERRRR BEEAAAASTTT" sound effect and visual plays.
You respawn as **Incarnate**!
You also of course get all of **Incarnate**'s starting items.
You get a counter on the top right that shows how much you've spent.

Since [Mark of the Beast]() and [Vintage of Abiezer](/docs/items/passive/amazing/Vintage of Abiezer/idea.md) are such rare yet super interesting items, this gives a chance to play with them in a fun challenge.
