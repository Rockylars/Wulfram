### The visual:

Looks exactly like Minä from Noita, bright purple robe and a black, unseen face, beige hands are visible.

---

### Stats:

**Minä**'s health up will give a red heart container.

You start with:
- [Backpack](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Backpack)
- [Deep pockets](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Deep_Pockets)
- Starting Wand, active item
- Bomb Wand, second active item
- Potion Flask, pocket active item

**Minä**'s health is:
- 3 full red hearts
- Higher max health cap like **Tainted Magdalene**'s Birthright

**Minä**'s stats are:
- Base **Isaac** stats, maybe a bit higher speed

**Minä** has the innate benefit and downside of:
- Can carry 4 pocket items.
- No pickups except money, golden chests and large chests, all wrong spawns are cancelled out.
  - Golden chests will always either contain:
    - rarely a [Health Up](/docs/challenges/The%20Witching%20Hour/items/passive/buffs/Health%20Up/idea.md).
    - uncommon chance of a [Spell refresher](/docs/challenges/The%20Witching%20Hour/items/passive/buffs/Spell%20Refresher/idea.md).
    - a lot of pennies.
    - a random wand/spell.
    - super rarely a [Health Restore](/docs/challenges/The%20Witching%20Hour/items/passive/buffs/Health%20Restore/idea.md).
  - Great chests will have the same stuff but just amplified, so instead you would get more pennies, higher tier spells/wands and higher chances of the buff items such as [Health Up](/docs/challenges/The%20Witching%20Hour/items/passive/buffs/Health%20Up/idea.md), [Spell refresher](/docs/challenges/The%20Witching%20Hour/items/passive/buffs/Spell%20Refresher/idea.md) and [Health Restore](/docs/challenges/The%20Witching%20Hour/items/passive/buffs/Health%20Restore/idea.md).
- Enemies drop pennies that disappear like with **Tainted Keeper**.
- Different tinted rock loot.
  - Tinted rocks will spawn 1-3 dimes.
  - Often they are replaced as cluster of fool's gold.
- Mana management
  - You will have a bar for mana below your hearts.
- Recharge timer
  - You will have a bar for recharge time below your hearts.
- Golden key on every floor.
  - **Minä** will begin every floor with a golden key.
- Trinket area or item area is replaced by the spell storage.
- 

Your currently selected wand will determine your stats and spells (tears) cast out, with some buffs applying on top of that like Berserkium.
The active item button and drop button are repurposed for the pocket active, as that needs 2 more actions.

The wand you hold is held out in front of you like [Spear of Destiny](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Spear_of_Destiny).

You gain a kick attack which deals heavy knockback.

You can levitate (fly) when holding space, this also grants you spectral.
Spells that fall down will not have infinite spectral.
This levitate mechanic is still in debate but would help with thin rooms and scary spells.
