### The visual:

Looks exactly like Minä from Noita, bright purple robe and a black, unseen face, beige hands are visible.

### Stats:

**Minä**'s health up will give a red heart container.

You start with:
- [Backpack](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Backpack)
- [Deep pockets](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Deep_Pockets)
- Starting Wand, active item
- Bomb Wand, second active item
- Potion Flask, pocket active item

**Minä**'s health is:
- 3 full red hearts
- Higher max health cap like **Tainted Magdalene**'s Birthright

**Minä**'s stats are:
- Base **Isaac** stats

**Minä** has the innate benefit and downside of:
- Can carry 4 pocket items.
- No pickups except money, golden chests and large chests, all wrong spawns are cancelled out.
  - Golden chests will always either contain:
    - rarely a [Health Up](/docs/challenges/The%20Witching%20Hour/items/passive/buffs/Health%20Up/idea.md).
    - uncommon chance of a [Spell refresher](/docs/challenges/The%20Witching%20Hour/items/passive/buffs/Spell%20Refresher/idea.md).
    - a lot of pennies.
    - a random wand/spell.
    - super rarely a [Health Restore](/docs/challenges/The%20Witching%20Hour/items/passive/buffs/Health%20Restore/idea.md).
  - Great chests will have the same stuff but just amplified, so instead you would get more pennies, higher tier spells/wands and higher chances of the buff items such as [Health Up](/docs/challenges/The%20Witching%20Hour/items/passive/buffs/Health%20Up/idea.md), [Spell refresher](/docs/challenges/The%20Witching%20Hour/items/passive/buffs/Spell%20Refresher/idea.md) and [Health Restore](/docs/challenges/The%20Witching%20Hour/items/passive/buffs/Health%20Restore/idea.md).
- Enemies drop pennies that disappear like with **Tainted Keeper**.
- Different tinted rock loot.
  - Tinted rocks will spawn 1-3 dimes.
  - Often they are replaced as cluster of fool's gold.
- Mana management
  - You will have a bar for mana below your hearts.
- Recharge timer
  - You will have a bar for recharge time below your hearts.
- Golden key on every floor.
  - **Minä** will begin every floor with a golden key.
- Trinket area or item area is replaced by the spell storage.
