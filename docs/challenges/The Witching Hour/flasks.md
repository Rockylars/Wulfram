An active item with 10 pips, will immediately equip in the pocket slot.

This use item can rarely spawn in Secret rooms or Vault rooms.
It has many uses, a sip can be taken from it, it can be thrown (one time) or it can be used to create a spray with a creep splash.
Every floor you will gain a new [liquid](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Liquid) inside your empty flasks by placing it in the alchemy table.

Not all liquids are added, only the basic and interesting ones as most are more for material interaction and not for Minä to drink or throw.

Combining liquids is added, but it will only rarely occur.

Running a "temporary" clicker is also very fucky to the game, best answer is probably to create a temporary second character.
