Minä will not find any pickups or drops aside of pennies and golden chests.
No bombs, keys, hearts, trinkets, chests, sacks, cards, pills, soulstones, runes or anything.
All room drops except golden chests are cancelled out.
Golden chests will thus actually rarely spawn and always contain either a wand or a lot of money
Every enemy will drop at least 3 pennies and drop more based on their HP.
Tinted rocks will spawn 3 dimes, or maybe we respawn it as cluster of fool's gold.

Minä will begin every floor with a golden key.

The shop sells only items and is a **Tainted Keeper** shop.
The items in particular are all spells or rarely all wands.
Treasure rooms will have wands and the doors are always unlocked.

The active item will have the Tainted Isaac Birthright selection.
You get to drop spells with the bomb button, this spawns an item pedestal.

The flask will be filled with a random liquid each floor, you can use the use button to throw a spray of it out that creates creep of it and the swap button to take a swig.
It'll have things such as Acid, Berserkium, Lava, Water and Pheromones.

You start with 12 soul hearts and heal

Trinket area or item area is replaced by the spell storage.

Starting room spawns a perk item, except for the first floor.
