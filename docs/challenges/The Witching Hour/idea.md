[Noita](https://noitagame.com/) and Isaac both have a Lua modding scene.
This has caused a big overlap of the people from Isaac Modding to also work on Noita modding.
A bunch of good mods such as [The Binding of Noita](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2149928755) and [others](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=881100&searchtext=isaac) have already been made, but not much has been done in the opposite direction.
There was a Witch Wand item as a reference in one mod I saw, but nothing other than that.

This is here to fix that!
Bringing a completely unique challenge where you are Minä from Noita!
Though this is scuffed as all hell, it aims to bring over most of the important features such as:

- Spells
  - Limited usage spells
    - Spell refreshing
  - Chained spells
  - Modifier spells
  - Multicasts and whatnot
  - Limited spell storage
  - Spell purchasing
  - Spell discarding
  - Spell discovery in chests
- Wands
  - Spell swapping
  - Spell removal
  - Disabled editing outside the starter room, tough luck if you messed up.
    - Unless you have the Edit Wands Everywhere perk
  - Holding multiple wands
  - Finding/purchasing wands
- Flasks
  - Auto refill upon going to a new floor
  - Filling...?
  - Spraying
  - Drinking
    - ..drinking creep?
  - Throwing..?
  - ..maybe holding multiple?
- Perks
  - A choice between 3 (or 4 with the Extra Perk perk) on a new floor
  - Many, many choices and effects.

This mod by itself will be very similar to how [Nemesis](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2501339433) works, except instead of "trinket" Flasks, we use active item wands.
We also allow them to be edited instead of solely being randomly generated.
Since Minä will not encounter trinkets, we will also put the spell details in the same position instead of filling up the space under the active item with clutter.
