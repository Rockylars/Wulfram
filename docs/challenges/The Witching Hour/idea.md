### The concept:

[Noita](https://noitagame.com/) and Isaac both have a Lua modding scene.
This has caused a big overlap of the people from Isaac Modding to also work on Noita modding.
A bunch of good mods such as [The Binding of Noita](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2149928755) and [others](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=881100&searchtext=isaac) have already been made, but not much has been done in the opposite direction.
There was a Witch Wand item as a reference in one mod I saw, but nothing other than that.

This is here to fix that!
Bringing a completely unique challenge where you are Minä from Noita!
Though this is scuffed as all hell, it aims to bring over most of the important features such as:

- Spells
  - Limited usage spells
    - Spell refreshing
  - Chained spells
  - Modifier spells
  - Multicasts and whatnot
  - Limited spell storage
  - Spell purchasing
  - Spell discarding
  - Spell discovery in chests
- Wands
  - Spell swapping
  - Spell removal
  - Disabled editing outside the starter room, tough luck if you messed up.
    - Unless you have the Edit Wands Everywhere perk
  - Holding multiple wands
  - Finding/purchasing wands
- Flasks
  - Auto refill upon going to a new floor
  - Filling...?
  - Spraying
  - Drinking
    - ..drinking creep?
  - Throwing..?
  - ..maybe holding multiple?
- Perks
  - A choice between 3 (or 4 with the Extra Perk perk) on a new floor
  - Many, many choices and effects.

This mod by itself will be very similar to how [Nemesis](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2501339433) works, except instead of "trinket" Flasks, we use active item wands.
We also allow them to be edited instead of solely being randomly generated.
Since Minä will not encounter trinkets, we will also put the spell details in the same position instead of filling up the space under the active item with clutter.

### The visual:

Looks exactly like Minä, bright purple robe and a black, unseen face, beige hands are visible.

---

### Stats:

**Minä**'s health up will give a red heart container.

You start with:
- Backpack
- Deep pockets
- Starting Wand, active item
- Bomb Wand, second active
- Potion Flask, pocket active

**Minä**'s health is:
- 4 full red hearts
- Higher max health cap like **Tainted Magdalene**'s Birthright

**Oreb**'s stats are:
- 1.20 speed
- 3 luck
- Flight
- Feather shaped tears

Minä will not find any pickups or drops aside of pennies and golden chests.
No bombs, keys, hearts, trinkets, chests, sacks, cards, pills, soulstones, runes or anything.
All room drops except money and golden chests are cancelled out.
Golden chests will thus actually rarely spawn and always contain either a wand or a lot of money
Every enemy will drop at least 3 pennies and drop more based on their HP.
Tinted rocks will spawn 3 dimes, or maybe we respawn it as cluster of fool's gold.

Minä will begin every floor with a golden key.

The shop sells only items and is a **Tainted Keeper** shop.
The items in particular are all spells or rarely all wands.
Treasure rooms will have wands and the doors are always unlocked.

The active item will have the Tainted Isaac Birthright selection.
You get to drop spells with the bomb button, this spawns an item pedestal.

The flask will be filled with a random liquid each floor, you can use the use button to throw a spray of it out that creates creep of it and the swap button to take a swig.
It'll have things such as Acid, Berserkium, Lava, Water and Pheromones.

Trinket area or item area is replaced by the spell storage.

### Rooms:

**Starting room:**
<br>
spawns a perk item, except for the first floor.

**Shop room:**
Sells wands or spells, with an increasing quality and price per floor.
The price can go up to 999.

---

### Health and Refreshers:

Mina will find no Isaac items at all, but will find Wands, Spells, Full Health Regenerators, Health ups and Spell refreshers.

### Wands:

---

### Spells:

---

### Flasks:

- Invisibilium
  - Spraying it on the floor will create a puddle of "turns enemies into invisible champions" juice.
    - Why would you ever do this.
    - What have you done.
  - Drinking it or standing in it gives the [Camo Undies]()'s invisibility effect until you shoot.
- Pheromones:
  - Spraying it on the floor will create a puddle of charming creep.
    - Spraying it on the floor under a wand will turn that wand into Charmed Taikusauva, making the wand be controlled by a ghost **Minä**
      - If the wand has no spells, it is sold instead.
  - Drinking it or standing in it has no effect.
