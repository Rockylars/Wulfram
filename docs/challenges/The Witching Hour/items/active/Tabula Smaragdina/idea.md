- Equips as a pocket item.
- Using it will throw it towards an enemy, dealing insane damage with piercing if it kills the enemy.
  - Will drop as a pickup if it does not kill the enemy.
  - Will also drop to the floor if it travels far enough without hitting anything or hits the wall.
  - Flies over rocks and pits, be careful not to throw it where you can't retrieve it.
- Forgetting to pick it up will leave it in that room.
- Using it instead of throwing it will display a line from one of the tablet texts.
