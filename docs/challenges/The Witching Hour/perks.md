Perks are passive items that spawn in every starting room except for the first floor.
Every time they come in a choice of 3 unless you have **Extra Perk**.

Most of the perks skip out on the full explanation in their text to make people learn more about Noita and experiment more. Also it just won't fit in Isaac.

Damage types are going to be hard to add.
Making some enemies and yourself take more damage from some types is rather difficult when health is displayed in hearts and there's so many monsters.
We could definitely do it, but it sure is something.
It might mean Min√§ needs a different health bar, which was already in my plans somewhat, but it kinda makes this whole thing overkill?

[Q3] [All-Seeing Eye](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/All-Seeing_Eye_(Perk)): "You can now see everywhere"
<br>
Grants the effect of [The Mind](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mind).

[Q2] [Always Cast](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Always_Cast_(Perk)): "A random Always Cast spell is added"
<br>
Adds a random always cast spell to your currently held wand.
Uses roughly the same chance table to give a higher chance for a projectile modifier spell and such.

[Q4] [Angry Ghost](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Angry_Ghost): "An angry spirit comes to your aid"
<br>
Grants a familiar similar to [Incubus](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Incubus), but with no damage reduction.
Will not fire shots copied from what the enemies are firing.

[Q3] [Attract Gold](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Attract_Gold): "Pennies gravitate towards you"
<br>
Grants the effect of [Broken Magnet](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Magnet).

~~[Bombs Materialized](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Bombs_Materialized)~~
<br>
Although the idea is interesting, the game would not have the right way of dropping and equipping spells to your pocket slot, as you don't have enough buttons for it.

[Q1] [Boomerang Spells](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Boomerang_Spells): "Your spells arc towards you"
<br>
Grants a buffed version of [My Reflection](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/My_Reflection).
<br>
{damage type increase} projectile

[Q3] [Bouncing Spells](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Bouncing_Spells): "Almost all your spells bounce around"
<br>
Grants a mix of a big range up and [Rubber Cement](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Rubber_Cement).
Will add a [Flat Stone](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Flat_Stone) effect for spells with gravity.

~~[Breathless](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Breathless)~~
<br>
Serves no use.

[Q2] [Close Call](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Close_Call): "You gain additional chance to deal critical hits"
<br>
Will work like how it works in Noita instead of cheaping out by just giving a crit chance to enemies close by.
Will give you a crit chance up when enemies are nearby, so it's a great combination with something like **Melee Immunity**.

[Q1] [Concentrated Spells](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Concentrated_Spells): "Your proficiency has been favored over your efficiency"
<br>
Grants certain stats up and down, exactly like the item in Noita.
<br>
{damage type increase} projectile, explosive

[Q2] [Contact Damage](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Contact_Damage): "Enemies are hurt by your fear"
<br>
Grants a purple, range nerfed version of [Monstrance](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Monstrance).
<br>
{damage type} melee

[Q3] [Cordyceps](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Cordyceps): "Friendly fungal creatures spawn from fresh corpses"
<br>
Grants something similar to the [Infestation 2](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Infestation_2), with a custom charmed mushroom enemy, perhaps something similar to the ones in Fiend Folio.

[Q2] [Critical hit +](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Critical_Hit_%2B): "Increased critical hit chance"
<br>
Grants a crit chance up, exactly like the item in Noita.

~~[Dissolve Powders](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Dissolve_Powders)~~
<br>
Useless, could auto-destroy poops, but it's just not fitting to the name.

~~[Eat Your Vegetables](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Eat_Your_Vegetables)~~
<br>
While this could be cool, only flasks would work and there's no easy way to refill em.
Corpses don't turn into meat unless we program that in.
This would probably be the most detrimental perk as you can't stand still or backtrack in the slightest without the fear of dying.

[Q2] [Electricity](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Electricity): "Immunity to electricity, though it's leaking out"
<br>
Grants [120 Volt](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/120_Volt) and potentially [Technology Zero](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Technology_Zero), as well as an immunity to the Stunned status effect.
<br>
{damage type immunity} electricity

[Q1] [Electricity Immunity](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Electricity_Immunity): "You take no damage from electric shocks"
<br>
Grants immunity to electric damage... of which there is none? We'll need to think if we want to add this one in.
<br>
{damage type immunity} electricity

[Q0] [Enemy Radar](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Enemy_Radar): "You can see all enemies"
<br>
All enemies in the room and all room-traversing enemies are highlighted with a glowing red ring (insert clickbait meme here), very useful for a dark room or underground enemies.
Not that useful in practice.

[Q4] [Exploding Corpses](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Exploding_Corpses): "Enemies explode upon death, explosions no longer hurt you"
<br>
After death, enemies blow up, but you become immune to explosions such as with [Host Hat](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Host_Hat) or [Pyromaniac](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Pyromaniac).
Removes Explosion Immunity from the perk pool, rerolls it if present on the floor such as with Perk Lottery.
<br>
{damage type immunity} explosive

[Q3] [Explosion Immunity](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Exploding_Corpses): "You take no damage from explosions"
<br>
After death, enemies blow up, but you become immune to explosions such as with [Host Hat](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Host_Hat) or [Pyromaniac](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Pyromaniac).
<br>
{damage type immunity} explosive

<br>
Grants an effect identical to [Blister](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Blister).

[Q3] [Extra Life](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Extra_Life): "Upon death you respawn with 3 hearts"
<br>
Grants an effect similar to [1up!](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/1up%21), you respawn in the previous room.

[Q3] [Extra Perk](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Extra_Perk): "From now on you will find an extra perk"
<br>
Spawns the starting room perk choice with 4 perks instead of 3.

<br>
Adds a guaranteed 3 extra slots to your active wand, up to the max.

<br>
Mato enemies no longer spawn, existing ones will no longer destroy rocks and leave the floor ASAP.

[Q2] [Fire Immunity](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Fire_Immunity): "You take no damage from fire"
<br>
Prevents fire damage like [Pyromaniac](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Pyromaniac) does.
<br>
{damage type immunity} fire

~~[Freeze Field](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Freeze_Field)~~
<br>
While cool (haha), this would only be reworked to slow down enemies instead (with a timer up until which they freeze, maybe), but that just seems weird to go against what the real perk would do in Noita.
Needs to be discussed.
<br>
{damage type immunity} fire

[Q2] [Fungal Colony](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Fungal_Colony): "Friendly fungal creatures spawn from slime"
<br>
Grants something similar to the [Infestation 2](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Infestation_2), with a custom charmed mushroom enemy, perhaps something similar to the ones in Fiend Folio.
They will spawn from a specific creep and use up said creep.

[Q0] [Fungal Disease](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Fungal_Disease): "When near danger, you sprout fungal growths"
<br>
Shoots out a bunch of spore pod spells when near enemies, though the darts that come from this will hurt you.
Worst perk?

[Q4] [Gamble](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Gamble): "You gain two random perks"
<br>
Two free perks!
This can never go wrong!
