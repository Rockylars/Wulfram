Perks are passive items that spawn in every starting room except for the first floor.
Every time they come in a choice of 3 unless you have **Extra Perk**.

Most of the perks skip out on the full explanation in their text to make people learn more about Noita and experiment more. Also it just won't fit in Isaac.

Damage types are going to be hard to add.
Making some enemies and yourself take more damage from some types is rather difficult when health is displayed in hearts and there's so many monsters.
We could definitely do it, but it sure is something.
It might mean Minä needs a different health bar, which was already in my plans somewhat, but it kinda makes this whole thing overkill?

We could add a levitation mechanic to where holding space will lift you up, but this just sounds annoying.
I'll come back to this, as Levitation Trail and Strong Levitation will be interesting perks for it.
If you were flying, you'd gain spectral, but it would be a limited flight time and would reuse the active item button.

<br>
Will work like how it works in Noita instead of cheaping out by just giving a crit chance to enemies close by.

[Q2] [Freeze Field](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Freeze_Field): "Enemies freeze in your presence"

{damage type immunity} fire

Worst perk?

Two free perks!
This can never go wrong!

<br>
The pennies dropped by enemies no longer flash and vanish.
Guaranteed run win, be careful with Luminous Drill and Black Hole spells however.

[Q3] [Greed](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Greed): "Your wealth doubles in value"
<br>
Every penny you pick up gives adds 2 rather than 1 in your penny counter.
You will win with this much money.

[Q2] [Healthy Exploration](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Healthy_Exploration): "Your exploration rewards you"
<br>
Very different from Noita, since biomes aren't really here, instead rewards exploration as far as we can let it.
Visiting every room (except the Ultra Secret room) on a floor will heal 2 hearts.
Visiting a new floor will heal 2 hearts.

[Q3] [High Mana, Low Capacity](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/High_Mana,_Low_Capacity): "Half the capacity for significant Mana"
<br>
Your currently held wand becomes a glass cannon, with half the capacity but a significantly strengthened mana max and mana regen.

[Q3] [Homing](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Homing_Shots): "Your spells home towards enemies"
<br>
Grants you [Spoon Bender](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Spoon_Bender).

[Q2] [Homunculus](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Homunculus): "Every floor, a new helpful homunculus is summoned"
<br>

[Q1] [Low Recoil](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Low_Recoil): "Your proficiency has been favored over your efficiency"
<br>
Similar to Concentrated Spells, this perk reduces your recoil but also decreases shotspeed by 20%.
Generally not worth it in the slightest, since Isaac has walls, but still helpful to not get thrown into harmful objects or enemies.

[Q2] [Lukki Minion](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Lukki_Minion): "Summons a lukki minion to your aid"
<br>
You gain a follower similar to [Sissy Longlegs](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Sissy_Longlegs), though this one actively chases enemies and damages them.

<br>
{damage type immunity} melee

[Q0] [More Blood](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/More_Blood): "Blood blood blood"
<br>
I see no good way of adding this without flooding the room with red creep, but it's funny.
Everyone now bleeds (more) red creep, including you, when being hit.
You still take damage from enemy blood creep, though I'd say it's more mental damage.
Works well for Vampirism.
Will increase Oil Blood, Gas Blood and other blood perks by triple the amount.

[Q4] [More Hatred](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/More_Hatred): "Creatures become more aggressive towards each other"
<br>
Causes a [Rotten Tomato](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Rotten_Tomato)-esque effect on everyone, permanently.
Has a chance to create a bullet hell.

[Q1] [More Love](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/More_Love): "Creatures become more friendly towards each other"
<br>
Certain small enemies (such as flies and spiders) become charmed or no longer attack you.
Since infighting is a super rare mechanic aside of how charm works in Isaac, this is the best I could do.

[Q1] [More Love](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/More_Love): "Creatures become more friendly towards each other"
<br>
Certain small enemies (such as flies and spiders) become charmed or no longer attack you.
Since infighting is a super rare mechanic aside of how charm works in Isaac, this is the best I could do.

[Q2] [Never Skip Leg Day](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Never_Skip_Leg_Day): "Your kicks deal extra damage and knockback"

[Q0] [No More Wand Tinkering](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/No_Wand_Tinkering): "Wands cannot be tinkered with, but enemies may drop blood money"
<br>
Why would you ever take this you dolt.
It means you can no longer edit wands at all, but enemies have a low chance to drop pennies that look like and work similar to [Bloody Penny](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Bloody_Penny).
Blood money heals you for half a heart, which is ten times stronger than how it works in Noita already.

[Q2] [Oil Blood](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Oil_Blood): "You bleed flammable oil, but are immune to fire"
<br>
Works with More Blood.
You bleed flammable oil creep all around you.

<br>

[Q4] [Perk Lottery](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Perk_Lottery): "Toss the [Crooked Penny](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Crooked_Penny) to your Witch"
<br>
Congrats, you just got the best perk in both games.
When picking up a perk, there's a 50% chance all the other choice perks don't disappear.
This also triggers when picking up this very perk.

[Q4] [Permanent Shield](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Permanent_Shield): "You gain a small, permanent shield"
<br>
Grants a shield around Minä that reflects projectiles similar to [Telekinesis](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Telekinesis).
The shield will be damaged by Levitation Trail particles.
Taking a large amount of damage will temporarily break the shield.

[Q3] [Personal Plasma Beam](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Personal_Plasma_Beam): "You constantly fire a devastating plasma beam, at a cost.."
<br>
You constantly have a short range high damage magic plasma beam in front of you.
The beam will break rocks and blow up barrels.
Your spells now fire with a lot more delay.

[Q0] [Phasing](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Phasing): "Projectiles seemingly phase through you, at a cost.."
<br>
Tears fired by enemies have a 50% chance of going through you.
Has some similarity with [Infamy](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Infamy).
You now have a 50% chance to take double damage from those that do hit you (to mimic the 33% projectile and explosive damage vulnerability).

[Q1] [Pinpointer](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Pinpointer): "Your spells fly faster and have lower spread"
<br>
Thought of adding [Marked](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Marked) or [Tractor Beam](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Tractor_Beam) to make this more interesting, instead went for a simple red guideline.
Reduces spread by 20 degrees and increases projectile speed (shotspeed) by 40%.
Might add [Marked](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Marked) later if this is too boring.

[Q3] [Plague Rats](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Plague_Rats): "Dying enemies release rats to serve your bidding!"
<br>
Spawns a friendly Rat enemy (needs to be added) from dying enemies that attacks them.
Their HP and damage scale with the floor you're on.
They disappear after a while.

[Q0] [Projectile Duplication](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Projectile_Duplication): "Your projectile spells have a chance to duplicate, at a cost.."
<br>
You now have a 50% chance to shoot a duplicate spell projectile.
You now have a 50% chance to take double damage from those that hit you (to mimic the 25% projectile damage vulnerability).
<br>
{damage type vulnerability} projectile4

[Q3] [Projectile Eater](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Projectile_Eater): "Projectiles that fly into a small sector behind you disappear"
<br>

---

[Q1] [Levitation Trail -> Magic Trail](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Levitation_Trail): "You leave a trail of magical sparks"
<br>
Since levitation isn't in Isaac, this skill is reused to create a trail of tiny projectiles that will home onto enemies very close to them.

[Q2] [Mournful Spirit -> Mournful Spirits](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Mournful_Spirit): "Dying creatures leave behind a spirit"
<br>
Enemies leave behind a spirit upon death similar to [Vade Retro](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Vade_Retro).
They damage other enemies in a small radius (with curse damage).
They slowly move towards the enemies.

---

[Bombs Materialized](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Bombs_Materialized)
<br>
Although the idea is interesting, the game would not have the right way of dropping and equipping spells to your pocket slot, as you don't have enough buttons for it.

[Breathless](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Breathless)
<br>
Serves no use.

[Dissolve Powders](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Dissolve_Powders)
<br>
Useless, could auto-destroy poops, but it's just not fitting to the name.

[Eat Your Vegetables](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Eat_Your_Vegetables)
<br>
While this could be cool, only flasks would work and there's no easy way to refill em.
Corpses don't turn into meat unless we program that in.
This would probably be the most detrimental perk as you can't stand still or backtrack in the slightest without the fear of dying.

[Faster Levitation](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Faster_Levitation)
<br>
There's no levitation in Isaac, even if we added the mechanic this only aids it vertically, not horizontally.

[Iron Stomach](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Iron_Stomach)
<br>
Due to the limited materials, Minä can not overeat in this challenge, rendering this perk useless.

[Item Radar](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Item_Radar)
<br>
This would be a complicated thing as rooms are not persistent, they do persist but not constantly.
The closest thing I could think of is to give a weaker version of All-Seeing Eye, where you can see the item room and the shop on the map.
It would get annoying if implemented 1:1, as you'd have a constant highlighter you can't turn off.
All-Seeing Eye could also be nerfed so it only shows all normal rooms on the map instead.

[Peace with Gods](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Peace_with_Gods)
<br>
There is no destruction of the "Holy Temple", so this is useless.
