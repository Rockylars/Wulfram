### The concept

The idea for Tainted Oreb to fully dive into the thievery, requiring you to steal devil deals, steal item room items and get riches from the shop.
His mindset of the world working in opposite ways still counts, as money now speeds you up instead and your items come from devil/angel deals and the shop rather than item rooms.

Tainted Oreb gets greed shops, having to sadly part with some money but more than willing for these stolen, underworld goods, as the money is everpresent and unending.
He must find ways at all cost to get money, to steal anything he can to obtain more stolen riches, with the shops now offering higher quality items from every item pool, guaranteed quality 2 and higher.

He is not without worry though, as his dead body in the afterlife is only allowed to get bone and black hearts, with this unstable form having them shuffle at every room he enters.
Devil deals still only appear if he takes bone heart damage, with black heart damage causing him to lose it.
