### The concept

The idea for **Tainted Oreb** to fully embrace his opposite nature through the afterlife's land of chaos, trying to usurp the kingdom of death just as him and his people did before with the living.
**Tainted Oreb** has collected various riches, powers and curses among his travels through the nether realm, but sin will only get him deeper in trouble.

Item rooms are guarded by angels, which are rather angry when you "borrow" their treasures.
Devil deals become free but choice items and are guarded by fallen angels, which are there to take your soul as their payment.

**Tainted Oreb** gets **Tainted Keeper** shops, having to pay with his stolen riches for these underworld goods.
He must find ways at all cost to get money, using his Eye(s) of Greed to take anything he can, for the shops are offering higher quality items and Chaos'd items from every item pool.
Guaranteed quality 2 and higher items are only available to buy next to consumables.
The shop offers black hearts for sale instead of red hearts, but at a doubled price.

**Tainted Oreb** has **Bethany**'s soul counter, which can be used to gain more power for his items.
Black hearts will not go into this counter, they will be taken by him, but eternal hearts will go in, being worth 3 points.
This means **Tainted Oreb** loses the benefit that **Oreb** had, with black hearts still being favored by the devil now being far harder to obtain as soul hearts are no longer converted into them

His mindset of the world working in opposite ways still counts, as money now gains you massive value compared to item rooms.
He is not without worry though, as his dead body in the afterlife is only allowed to get bone and black hearts, with this unstable form having them shuffle at every room he enters.
Devil deals still only appear if he takes bone heart damage, with black heart damage causing him to lose it.

Any bone heart damage taken will remove the devil deal's appearance from that floor, but the fragile bird gains some bone fragments circling him to prevent further damage.
He must be swift, vigilant and risk bearing to obtain his conquering hold, being sure his Eye of Greed tear and relevant money spending does not go to waste.
Compared to **Oreb**, his bony body is now perfectly capable of storing extra money, keys and bombs rather than those weaker feathered wings, so no collectibles will be thrown out.

Red health does not spawn, being converted to a penny, **Tainted Oreb** can only have empty bone hearts anyways.
Eternal hearts are replaced by full black hearts.

### How does Tainted Oreb gain access to the Mega Satan fight?

**Tainted Oreb** will have to fight the angels from the item room before picking up birthright.

**Tainted Oreb** can still gain key pieces by sacrifice rooms, stairway or red angel rooms.
