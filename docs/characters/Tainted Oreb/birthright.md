**Text:** Devil's offering + Strength from beyond the veil

**Devil's offering:**
- Item rooms will be replaced by devil deals, but costing money like **Keeper**.
- If **Tainted Oreb** holds Devil's Crown, they will be filled with angel items.
- This is meant to be a darker black market.

**Strength from beyond the veil**
- **Zeeb the ghost wolf** spawns in as a second but uncontrollable character.
- **Zeeb** moves around like a [Dople](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Dople), being like [Abel](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Abel) where he is always on the opposite side.
- **Zeeb** slashes at enemies he hovers over with his wolf claws.
- **Zeeb** can fly through obstacles, unlike the living variant of **Zeeb**.
