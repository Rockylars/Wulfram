### The concept:

The idea for Oreb is very much focused on crows/ravens, corrupt hearts, being killed by Gideon, being shunned by God and especially Crow's Heart.
Health for Oreb should work entirely opposite, with the challenge being to spend as much money as possible.
His innate and buffed It Hurts encourages sacrifice far more, especially now that the rare soul heart is no longer damaged and devil chance is no longer lost when doing so.

Oreb spawns with:
- [*Visible*] Smelted Crow's Heart
- [*Hidden*] Smelted Broken Magnet
- [*Visible*] Smelted Black Feather
- Held Bloody Crown
- Held Tammy's Head (not in pocket)

Oreb's health is:
- One full red heart
- One full black heart
- One golden heart (on the black heart)

Oreb's stats are:
- 1.20 speed
- 3 luck
- Flight
- Feather shaped tears


Oreb has the innate benefit and downside of:
- [Q1] **Careless Command** - "Warfare at any cost"
  - (benefit/downside) Will have a 1% chance to replace your tear with:
    - Greed's Eye shot if money is above 15.
    - Dr. Fetus shot if bombs are above 15.
    - Sharp Key shot if keys are above 15.
  - Firing this shot will still deduct the collectibe in question.
- [Q0] **Feather Flight** - "Speedy wings"
  - Speed ups only give half their respective speed up.
  - Speed up items follow this same logic.
  - Speed down is also halved for playability reasons.
  - Speed down items follow this same logic.
  - All flight items give a massive 0.5 speed up.
- [Q3] **Forsaken** - "Deuteronomy 28:20 - For your tainted soul, wicked mind and vexed body "
  - Devil deals now prioritize soul/black heart damage rather than red heart damage.
  - You can no longer gain angel rooms through conventional means.
- [Q2] **Hyperopia** - "Farsighted"
  - Spectral tears up to a short distance, after which they turn normal
  - Allows you to shoot through rocks from close up, which is when spectral is most important
- [Q1] **Oreb's Fate** - "Judges 6:14"
  - Losing an eternal heart will turn you into the Lost form for the rest of the floor.
  - Losing an eternal heart will grant a temporary moderate tears up for the rest of the floor.
  - All soul hearts are converted to their respective black hearts.
- [Q3] **Sinner's Remorse** - "A price to pay"
  - Angel deals are no longer a choice item.
  - They will cost money similar to Greed's angel deals.
  - You lose 2 luck for buying one of them.
  - They cost double the price compared to Greed.
  - Oreb can still rarely acquire these through angel deal red rooms, Stairway, etc.


- [Q2] **Warmonger** - "Through blood and tears"
  - [*This item does not spawn for anyone else*]
  - Buffed version of It Hurts, lasting for 3 rooms.
  - Also a nerfed version, as this does not ignore the tear cap.
  - Releases only 6 tears, 4 in all the diagonal directions and 2 sideways.
  - The tears released inflict fear.
- [Q0] **Stolen Riches** - "Full pockets"
  - [*This item does not spawn for anyone else*]
  - Coins will severely diminish speed, 0.02 per coin.
  - This downside will however consider speed stats above the cap before lowering.
- [Q1] **Undead Bird** - "Bird is big, and now he is small"
  - [*This item does not spawn for anyone else*]
  - Entering the Lost form will spawn a Dead Bird familiar for the duration of the Lost form.

### All Oreb's health changes:

**Crow's Heart:**
- Red hearts: All need to be removed to trigger golden hearts.
- Eternal hearts: Are now always the first to go.
- Golden hearts: Now require you to have and damage a soul heart to trigger, rather damn difficult with that much red health.
- Bone hearts: Less valuable as they take up soul heart space and are difficult to remove
- Rotten hearts: They get damaged after red hearts, making them stronger, but still weaker as soul hearts no longer protect them.

**Forsaken:**
- Red hearts: Losing them no longer loses the devil deal.
- Soul/Black hearts: Now trigger the devil deal loss and are priced as valuable as red heart containers by the devil.

**Oreb's Fate:**
- Soul hearts: Are converted into black hearts upon spawning or being given.
- Eternal hearts: Losing one turns Oreb into the Lost for the rest of the floor, like Tainted Jacob being hit by Dark Esau, but will grant a tears up for the floor.

### How does Oreb gain access to the Mega Satan fight?

Oreb can only gain key pieces by sacrifice rooms, stairway or red angel rooms.
