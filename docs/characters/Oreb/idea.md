### The concept:

The idea for **Oreb** is very much focused on crows/ravens, corrupt hearts, being killed by Gideon, being shunned by God and especially [Crow Heart](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Crow_Heart).
Health for **Oreb** should work entirely opposite, with the challenge being to spend as much money as possible.
His innate and buffed [It Hurts](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/It_Hurts) encourages sacrifice far more, especially now that the rare soul heart is no longer damaged and devil chance is lost in less ways.

### The visual:

Crow character with a visible beak, nothing more to be said.
Should start with purple eyes due to having black feathers all over the body and head.
Purple represents royalty and corruption the best, as well as being the soul stone color.

### Stats:

**Oreb**'s health up will give a red heart container.

**Oreb** spawns with:
- Smelted [Crow Heart](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Crow_Heart) trinket
- Smelted [Broken Magnet](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Magnet) trinket
- Smelted [Black Feather](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Feather) trinket
- Held [Bloody Crown](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Bloody_Crown) trinket
- Held [Tammy's Head](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Tammy's_Head) active item

**Oreb**'s health is:
- One full red heart
- One full black heart
- One golden heart (on the black heart)

**Oreb**'s stats are:
- 1.30 speed (and 0.70 minimum speed)
- 3 luck
- Flight
- Feather shaped tears
- 3.0 speed cap
- 5 contact damage per tick.

**Oreb** has the innate benefit and downside of:
- [Careless Command](/docs/items/passive/shit/Careless%20Command/idea.md)
  - Will have a 1% chance to replace your tear with an [Eye of Greed](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Greed), [Dr. Fetus](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Fetus) or [Sharp Key](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Sharp_Key) shot if the respective pickup is above 15.
  - Firing this shot will still deduct the collectible in question.
- [Eclipse](/docs/items/passive/amazing/Eclipse/idea.md)
  - Speed up's/down's only give half their respective speed up.
  - All wing items give a massive 0.5 speed up.
  - Grants flight
  - Raises the speed cap to 3.0
- [Forsaken](/docs/items/passive/okay/Forsaken/idea.md)
  - Devil deals now prioritize soul/black heart damage rather than red heart damage.
  - You can no longer gain angel rooms through conventional means.
  - All held/spawned soul hearts are converted to their respective black hearts.
- [Q2] **Hyperopia** - "Farsighted"
  - Spectral tears up to a short distance, after which they turn normal.
  - Allows you to shoot through rocks from close up, which is when spectral is most important.
  - If you already have an item that gives spectral, the tears will deal 1.5x damage at long range instead.
  - Check if this item is even needed.
- [Oreb's Fate](/docs/items/passive/shit/Oreb%27s%20Fate/idea.md)
  - Losing an eternal heart will turn you into **The Lost** form for the rest of the floor.
  - Doing so also grants a moderate tears up for the rest of the floor.
  - Also spawns a [Dead Bird](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_Bird) familiar for the duration of **The Lost** form.
- [Stolen Riches](/docs/items/passive/shit/Stolen%20Riches/idea.md)
  - Coins will severely diminish speed, 0.02 per coin.
  - Enemies have a 10% chance to drop a penny upon death.
- [Warmonger](/docs/items/passive/okay/Warmonger/idea.md)
  - Reimagined version of [It Hurts](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/It_Hurts), longer lasting tears up but weaker and different tear pattern.

TODO: Think of what to do with this one to either make it a personal item or make it more favorable.
- [Q3] **Sinner's Remorse** - "A price to pay"
  - Angel deals are no longer a choice item.
  - They will cost money similar to Greed's angel deals.
  - You lose 2 luck for buying one of them.
  - They cost double the price compared to Greed.
  - **Oreb** can still rarely acquire these through angel deal red rooms, Stairway, etc.

### All Oreb's health changes:

**Crow Heart:**
- Red hearts: All need to be removed to trigger golden hearts.
- Eternal hearts: Are now always the first to go.
- Golden hearts: Now require you to have and damage a soul heart to trigger, rather damn difficult with that much red health.
- Bone hearts: Less valuable as they take up soul heart space and are difficult to remove
- Rotten hearts: They get damaged after red hearts, making them stronger, but still weaker as soul hearts no longer protect them.

**Forsaken:**
- Red hearts: Losing them no longer loses the devil deal.
- Soul hearts: Are converted into black hearts upon spawning or being given.
- Black hearts: Now trigger the devil deal loss and are priced as valuable as red heart containers by the devil.

**Oreb's Fate:**
- Eternal hearts: Losing one turns **Oreb** into the Lost for the rest of the floor, like **Tainted Jacob** being hit by **Dark Esau**, but will grant a tears up for the floor.

### How does Oreb gain access to the Mega Satan fight?
