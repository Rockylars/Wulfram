[Oreb and Zeeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreb_and_Zeeb) are two [Midian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midian) princes (sometimes referred to as kings or captains) of the four royalties from Midian.
The other two royalties being the kings [Zebah and Zalmunna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebah_and_Zalmunna).
They were slain by Gideon after the Midians reigned over Israel for 7 years, in which they oppressed them as much as possible.
Oreb means Raven, Zeeb means wolf, Zebah means Sacrifice and Zalmunna means Shade denied.
Oreb was killed at the Rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress (a rocky trench for squishing grapes) of Zeeb.
Zebah and Zalmunna were later beheaded just like Oreb and Zeeb by Gideon's hands, but much later.

The Midianites are a folk coming from Midian, a son of [Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham) (father of Isaac), whose mother ([Keturah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keturah)) was his second wife.
There is not that much info about them, their pottery ([Qurraya ware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midianite_pottery)) suggests they were sea folk (people from greek islands) and their

Gideon and the Book of Judges is a big reference as well, as lots can be pulled from it.
Gideon did a lot of work with a tiny army to defeat every Midian troop, freeing them from the Midian oppression, but his words were forgotten decades later when he died.

This all came from an idea of [TurtleMelon's question of the day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmsOep1_HuY) inspiring me after his constant dismay at [Morvids](https://fiendfolio.wiki.gg/wiki/Morvid) in his previous episodes.
He tends to dislike the [Mothman](https://fiendfolio.wiki.gg/wiki/Mothman) enemies for the same reason, that they fly up and never seem to come down.

The name Wulfram (or Wolfram) means Wolf Raven, which perfectly fits this character idea, it was the original name for the character until I simply went with Oreb's actual name.
It's a character all about having flight, feather tears and reversed health, entirely based on the crow's heart item but expanded on it.
Really going after that Morvid crow design.
