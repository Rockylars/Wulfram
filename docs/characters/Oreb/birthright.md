**Text:** Midian Might + Evil prevails! + Atonement?

**Midian Might**
- **Zeeb the wolf** spawns in as a second but uncontrollable character.
- **Zeeb** moves around like a [Dople](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Dople), being like [Abel](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Abel) where he is always on the opposite side.
- **Zeeb** slashes at enemies he hovers over with his wolf claws.
- **Zeeb** will get stuck against obstacles, unlike the dead variant of **Zeeb**.
- **Zeeb** will bleed when he gets hit, leaving creep behind, but can never die.

**Evil prevails!**
- **Oreb** regains the ability to get angel deals.
- **Oreb** no longer turns into the lost upon losing an eternal heart.

**Atonement?**
- **Oreb** gets angel deals thanks to the prior benefits, but they now work similar to [Blood Atonement](/docs/items/passive/okay/Blood Atonement/idea.md).
- They can not be paid with black hearts.
- Angel deals require you to not take any damage.
- Stairway angel deals still cost money.
