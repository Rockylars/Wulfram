Item: Birthright

Text: Midian Might

His birthright needs to bring Zeeb back into the picture, moving around like a [Dople](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Dople), being like [Abel](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Abel) where he is always on the opposite side.
Zeeb should be a ghostly wolf (since he is also dead) that slashes at enemies.
Another option would be to make him more lively but to make Tainted Oreb have a dead Zeeb as birthright companion.

Birthright should also buff him up, such as no longer suffering the Curse of the Lost from losing an eternal heart.
It should not buff his coin carrying problem, as that would remove one of his main mechanics.
