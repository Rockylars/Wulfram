### The concept:

The idea for **Incarnate** is for it to be a mini version of The Beast.
It'll have a fire breath that goes around in a semicircle in front of in.
Immunity to fire and quite some interesting stats, range will increase the semicircle to a circle, to where it'll start looping back and shotspeed will send it out further.
The fire breath will appear and disappear rather quickly, with the flames not blocking any shots unlike other flame items.
The flames are really just retextured tears, but with different mechanics, such as multi shot items adding multiple layers of the semicircle.

**Incarnate** will be a hidden character, much like Dark Judas, where it'll only show up as a revive item, that being Mark of the Beast.
**Incarnate** will look like the Maw of the Void costume with 3 eyes.
The flames will take on the color of the current tear color modifier, they are moreso like Judas' Birthright with Urn of Souls flames.

### Stats:

**Incarnate**'s health up will give a red heart container.
