### The concept:

The idea for **Incarnate** is for it to be a mini version of The Beast.
It'll have a fire breath that goes around in a semicircle in front of in.
Immunity to fire and quite some interesting stats, range will increase the semicircle to a circle, to where it'll start looping back and shotspeed will send it out further.
The fire breath will appear and disappear rather quickly, with the flames not blocking any shots unlike other flame items.
The flames are really just retextured tears, but with different mechanics, such as multi shot items adding multiple layers of the semicircle.

**Incarnate** will be a hidden character, much like Dark Judas, where it'll only show up as a revive item, that being Mark of the Beast.

The flames will take on the color of the current tear color modifier, they are moreso like Judas' Birthright with Urn of Souls flames.

I might want to add a health mechanic related to fire, but nothing substantial has been thought of yet.
My initial idea will be to give him healing by touching a fire, but then damaging that fire by one stage when touched.
Sort of like a heat gauge that needs to be repeatedly upped, but it just seems annoying more than anything or too easy to fill.
It could go down one every combat room maybe, or simply one every room.
Though this would make backtracking rather difficult as in next to impossible.

### The visual

**Incarnate** will look like the Maw of the Void costume but with 3 eyes.
Basically a mix of Isaac and The Beast, as should be obvious.
**Incarnate** opens his maw every time he fires

### Stats:

**Incarnate**'s health up will give a red heart container.

**Incarnate** spawns with:
- Pocket active [Beast Blast](/docs/items/active/unobtainable/Beast Blast/idea.md)

**Incarnate**'s health is:
- One full red heart
- One full black heart

**Incarnate**'s stats are:
- 1.25 speed
- Fire shaped tears (tear color, starts orange)

**Incarnate** has the innate benefit and downside of:
- Fire ring
  - **Incarnate** will fire a semicircle of fire in front of him.
  - The semicircle can become a circle with enough range, as range increases how long the semicircle gets.
    - Even more range will cause the ring to wrap and the fires to double up, though it starts at the back unfortunately.
  - Shotspeed will send the ring out further before it disappears (and not range, yes I know, it's very ironic).
  - The ring doesn't go out far at all.
  - The fires will change color based on the tear color.
  - Multi shot modifiers (such as 20/20, Inner Eye and Quad Shot) will add an extra semicircle for each extra tear.
    - Quad shot will not mean you can fire across the whole room, the rings are very close to each other.
  - You have a small chance to inflict burning on the enemies.
  - Enemies that change when they get set on fire will change immediately upon getting hit.
- Fire immunity
  - **Incarnate** is immune to fire damage.
- Melee immunity
  - **Incarnate** is immune to contact damage.
- Lower chance of curses
  - Your mere existence is a curse enough.
- [Q2] Blessing of the damned: "Your choice has been made"
  - Minimum 15% devil deal chance.
    - This gets ignored with Goat Head.
    - This still affects Eucharist, reducing the angel deal chance to 85%.
  - Devil deal items become free but are now a choice item.
  - [Judas' Tongue](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Judas'_Tongue) and [Blue Tongue](/docs/trinkets/Blue Tongue/idea.md) get converted to a 1 damage up and this destroys the trinket.
- [Q2] [Blood Atonement](/docs/items/passive/okay/Blood Atonement/idea.md)
  - You're a demon, getting a bidding from them above needs some sacrifice.
- [Q3] [Cupid's Arrow](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cupid%27s_Arrow)
  - Your fires have piercing, low range without piercing is just a disaster.
  - If you somehow get more of these, they will give a 2.5 damage up.
- [Q1] [Hot Bombs](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Bombs):
  - Your bombs leave behind fire.
