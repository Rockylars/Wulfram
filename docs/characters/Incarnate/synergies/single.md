---

Homing will cause the projectile to gain a much longer lifespan if it still has the default super low lifespan of **Incarnate**'s tears.

---

**[Almond Milk](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Almond_Milk):** *better*
<br>
To make sure this isn't entirely run ending with the super low damage and range, this instead changes how you fire.
You become a constant flamethrower!
Your range will now influence your actual range, though it starts slow.

**[Anti-Gravity](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Anti-Gravity):** *better*
<br>
You become a pyromancer!
Your amount of fires gets reduced to one, but the amount you would fire ups your firerate.
You fire out a continuous stream of fire that stays in place.
Letting go of the firing key will send them off in the direction they were going (so you don't lose all range) and will then dissipate.
Multi shot items will increase the range and thickness of your fire stream.

If all of this is too much we can just keep the semi circle in place for a little longer than it normally exists, but that's rather boring.

**[Aquarius](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Aquarius):** *better*
<br>
Starts orange and applies burn, exactly like [Aquarius](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Aquarius) + [Fire Mind](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Mind).

**[Azazel's Rage](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Azazel%27s_Rage):** *same*
<br>
The brimstone is not **Incarnate**'s modified brimstone beam, it is a straight brimstone and in fact becomes a [Beast Blast](/docs/characters/Incarnate/items/active/Beast%20Blast/idea.md) brimestone beam!

**[Ball of Tar](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Ball_of_Tar):** *better*
<br>
The creep also applies burn and has a boiling effect.

**[Blood Clot](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Clot):** *same*
<br>
For every 2 shots you take, the second semicircle fired deals more damage.
This does not mean the 2nd layer, just simply how the item works for **Isaac**.

**[Brimstone](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Brimstone):** *worse with an upside*
<br>
Although [Beast Blast](/docs/characters/Incarnate/items/active/Beast%20Blast/idea.md) gives a straight brimstone, to make this more unique, **Incarnate** gets a semicircle brimstone.
The brimstone does last much longer than the flames would last, but this short range is still just horrible.
The brimstone still has a burning effect like the normal tears.
<br>
**x2:**
<br>
The brimstone semicircle is much thicker.

**[C Section](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/C_Section):** *unknown*
<br>
Each fetus attacks with a flamethrower, the fetuses themselves do not inflict burn.

**[Cain's Other Eye](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cain%27s_Other_Eye):** *same*
<br>
The eye fires out random flames at an increased speed.
The eye is crying out fire in random directions.
Another idea might be to make it shoot out normal tears but blood colored, giving some range to **Incarnate**.

**[Cricket's Body](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body):** *same*
<br>
The fires split into more fires if they hit something, with quite an explosive reach.

**[Cupid's Arrow](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cupid%27s_Arrow):** *better*
<br>
You already start with this item, if you somehow obtain more of them, they will give a 2.5 damage up instead of being useless.

**[Cursed Eye](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cursed_Eye):** *way better*
<br>
Works as you expect to how multi shot items were explained for **Incarnate**.
You fire multiple semicircles packed tight together in front of each other, which gives you a gigantic blast similar to [Monstro's Lung](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Monstro's_Lung) for **Isaac**.

**[Dr. Fetus](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Fetus):** *insane*
<br>
You will fire more bombs with more range, at 1 per range? Unsure about the count yet.
The bombs have a set range, but shotspeed increases it.
You also fire more bombs with multishot, adding an extra semicircle of them.
You also start with [Hot Bombs](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Bombs), so the bombs are all going to leave fire behind.

This might be too strong.

**[E. Coli](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/E._Coli):** *game breaking*
<br>
Since you take no contact damage, you pretty much win the game, until you gotta fight a boss.

**[Epic Fetus](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Epic_Fetus):** *better*
<br>
You spew random flames around you while aiming the airstrike shot.
Since you have [Hot Bombs](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Bombs), you will leave a fire behind on the explosion.

**[Evil Eye](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Evil_Eye):** *better*
<br>
The eye fires out random flames at an increased speed.

**[Eye of the Occult](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult):** *better*
<br>
Since **Incarnate** has non-existent range, this item is instead changed to be more like [Marked](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Marked).
You become a flamethrower, your semicircles get condensed into a single stream of flames, the amount you would fire ups your firerate.
Your tears will use the range stat to determine how long they live, as normal **Isaac** tears.
The tears will fly out straight but curve towards the occult mark.

**[Eyesore](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_Sore):** *same*
<br>
The extra flames are just single flames.

**[Flat Stone](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Flat_Stone):** *same*
<br>
Since **Incarnate**'s tears never land, they now gain the ability to travel forwards and bounce around until they turn too small.
The travel distance is rather short.

**[Fire Mind](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Mind):** *better*
<br>
The explosion does not harm you.

**[Godhead](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Godhead):** *same*
<br>
The aura is red instead.

**[Haemolacria](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Haemolacria):** *worse*
<br>
Your flames are lobbed out, with a set range as range still just increases the semicircle size.

**[Holy Mantle](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_Mantle):** *same*
<br>
The mantle is red instead.

**[Holy Water](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_Water):** *way worse*
<br>
The creep hurts you as well.

**[Incubus](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Incubus):** *worse*
<br>
Shoots out a flamethrower instead.

**[Ipecac](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Ipecac):** *better with a downside*
<br>
Your flames are lobbed out, with a set range as range still just increases the semicircle size.

**[Kidney Stone](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Kidney_Stone):** *same*
<br>
The tears that follow the kidney stone come out in a flamethrower style, exactly like how **Isaac** would shoot them.

**[Lachryphagy](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Lachryphagy):** *way worse*
<br>
The flames now linger for a bit longer and have a chance to absorb other flames to grow.
There's barely a chance they will absorb enough flames to explode.

**[Loki's Horns](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Loki%27s_Horns):** *same*
<br>
The extra tear shot out in all 4 directions is only just a single flame, not a whole semicircle.

**[Marked](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Marked):** *better*
<br>
You become a flamethrower, your semicircles get condensed into a single stream of flames, the amount you would fire ups your firerate.
Your tears will use the range stat to determine how long they live, as normal **Isaac** tears.

**[Midas' Touch](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Midas%27_Touch):** *game breaking*
<br>
Same as [E. Coli](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/E._Coli), this is a guaranteed easy mode item.

**[Mom's Knife](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife):** *better*
<br>
You will spew out random flames around you while charging the knife.

**[Monstro's Lung](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung):** *better*
<br>
The tears you fire, which are fires, spread out way more and can come in multiple layers with multi shot items.
You gain more actual range but lose some accuracy.

**[Mutant Spider](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Mutant_Spider):** *better*
<br>
Adds 3 extra semicircles of fire beyond your normal one.

**[My Reflection](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/My_Reflection):** *same*
<br>
Since range does not increase **Incarnate**'s actual range, this item being what it is gets a pass.
Your fire semicircle shoots out forwards and comes back before it vanishes.
The stats are altered to make sure it still works as intended.

**[Pop!](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Pop!):** *worse*
<br>
The semicircle of fire will spread all out from the instant bouncing.
The tears will now sizzle out and rather fast compared to normal [Pop!](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Pop!), since **Incarnate**'s tears never land.

**[Proptosis](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Proptosis):** *better*
<br>
Due to how range works for **Incarnate** and his super low tear lifespan, this item is changed a bit to become more interesting.
The tears further away from his front will deal less damage and those closer will deal way more damage.

**[Revelation](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Revelation):** *same*
<br>
The revelation beam is not affected by any modifiers of **Incarnate**'s semicircle firing method.

**[Rubber Cement](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Rubber_Cement):** *better*
<br>
The semicircle of fire will be pushed forwards when you're next to a wall.

**[Sad Bombs](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Sad_Bombs):** *same*
<br>
Shoots out a circle of fire.

**[Serpent's Kiss](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss):** *game breaking*
<br>
Same as [Midas' Touch](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Midas%27_Touch).
You just win.

**[Soy Milk](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Soy_Milk):** *better*
<br>
To make sure this isn't entirely run ending with the super low damage and range, this instead changes how you fire.
You become a constant flamethrower!
Your range will now influence your actual range, though it starts slow.

**[Spirit Sword](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Sword):** *better*
<br>
Your flame attack is now still somewhat there, but the sword does it instead.
The sword leaves behind a flame trail and inflicts the burn effect.
The flames act all act as a shot fired, so they all have their own modifiers.
The charge attack releases travelling flames, turning you into a temporary fire tornado.

**[Stapler](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Stapler):** *same*
<br>
This still just changes certain items from a 2nd shot to a chance item.

**[Technology](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Technology):** *better with a downside*
<br>
Does not stop the semicircle of fire from being created.
The laser does not have a burning effect.

**[Tech X](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Tech_X):** *better with a downside*
<br>
Does not stop the semicircle of fire from being created.
The laser does not have a burning effect.

**[The Inner Eye](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/The_Inner_Eye):** *better*
<br>
Adds 2 extra semicircles of fire beyond your normal one.

**[The Ludivico Technique](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique):** *way better*
<br>
You become a pyromancer!
The hovering tear will be a swirl of fire with more fire if you have multi shot items.

Fire tornado!!

**[The Wiz](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wiz):** *insane*
<br>
Although this is a multi shot item, this one is a bit special.
You now fire a full circle instead!
Range will still make the circle attempt to overlap, starting from behind.

**[Tiny Planet](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Tiny_Planet):** *way better*
<br>
You become a fire tornado, your semicircles get condensed into a single stream of flames, the amount you would fire ups your firerate.
Your tears will use the range stat to determine how long they live, as normal **Isaac** tears.
Your tears will keep circling you further and further, as they normally would with **Isaac**.

**[Tractor Beam](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Tractor_Beam):** *way better*
<br>
You become a flamethrower, your semicircles get condensed into a single stream of flames, the amount you would fire ups your firerate.
Your tears will use the range stat to determine how long they live, as normal **Isaac** tears.

**[Twisted Pair](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Twisted_Pair):** *worse*
<br>
Both shoot out a flamethrower instead.
