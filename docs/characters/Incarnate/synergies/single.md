**[Anti-Gravity](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Anti-Gravity):** *better*
<br>
You become a pyromancer!
Your amount of fires gets reduced to one, but the amount you would fire ups your firerate.
You fire out a continuous stream of fire that stays in place and now blocks tears.
Letting go of the firing key will send them off in the direction they were going (so you don't lose all range) and will then dissipate.
Multi shot items will increase the range and thickness of your fire stream.

If all of this is too much we can just keep the semi circle in place for a little longer than it normally exists, but that's rather boring.

**[Aquarius](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Aquarius):** *better*
<br>
Starts orange and applies burn, exactly like [Aquarius](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Aquarius) + [Fire Mind](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Mind).

**[Ball of Tar](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Ball_of_Tar):** *better*
<br>
The creep also applies burn and has a boiling effect.

**[Blood Clot](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Clot):** *same*
<br>
Either every other circle deals more damage, or one side of the semicircle does more damage, though this second idea seems more annoying than anything.

**[Brimstone](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Brimstone):** *worse*
<br>
Although [Beast Blast](/docs/items/active/unobtainable/Beast Blast/idea.md) gives a straight brimstone, to make this more unique, **Incarnate** gets a semicircle brimstone.
The brimstone does last much longer than the flames would last, but this short range is still just horrible.
<br>
**x2:**
<br>
The brimstone semicircle is much thicker.

**[Cain's Other Eye](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cain%27s_Other_Eye):** *same*
<br>
The eye fires out random flames at an increased speed, similar to when **Incarnate** holds [Technology](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Technology).
The eye is crying out fire in random directions.
Another idea might be to make it shoot out normal tears but blood colored, giving some range to **Incarnate**.

**[Cricket's Body](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body):** *same*
<br>
The fires split into more fires if they hit something, with quite an explosive reach.

**[Cupid's Arrow](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cupid%27s_Arrow):** *better*
<br>
You already start with this item, if you somehow obtain more of them, they will give a 2.5 damage up instead of being useless.

**[Cursed Eye](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cursed_Eye):** *way better*
<br>
Works as you expect to how multi shot items were explained for **Incarnate**.
You fire multiple semicircles packed tight together in front of each other, which gives you a gigantic blast similar to [Monstro's Lung](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Monstro's_Lung) for **Isaac**.

**[Dr. Fetus](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Fetus):** *insane*
<br>
You will fire more bombs with more range, at 1 per range? Unsure about the count yet.
You also fire more bombs with multishot, adding an extra semicircle of them.
You also start with [Hot Bombs](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Bombs), so the bombs are all going to leave fire behind.

**[E. Coli](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/E._Coli):** *game breaking*
<br>
Since you take no contact damage, you pretty much win the game, until you gotta fight a boss.

**[Epic Fetus](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Epic_Fetus):** *better*
<br>
You spew random flames around you while aiming the airstrike shot.
Since you have [Hot Bombs](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Bombs), you will leave a fire behind on the explosion.

**[Fire Mind](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Mind):** *better*
<br>
The explosion does not harm you.

**[Godhead](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Godhead):** *same*
<br>
The aura is red instead.

**[Holy Grail](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_Grail):** *same*
<br>
You gain black wings instead.

**[Holy Mantle](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_Mantle):** *same*
<br>
The mantle is red instead.

**[Holy Water](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_Water):** *way worse*
<br>
The creep hurts you as well.

**[Ipecac](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Ipecac):** *better*
<br>
The explosions do not damage you if they happened close up.

**[Loki's Horns](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Loki%27s_Horns):** *same*
<br>
The extra tear shot out in all 4 directions is only just a single flame, not a whole semicircle.

**[Mom's Knife](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife):** *better*
<br>
You will spew out random flames around you while charging the knife.
