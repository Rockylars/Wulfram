**Item:** Birthright
<br>
**Text:** Flame on!

- **Incarnate** will leave behind a trail of tiny flames wherever he walks.
- You will now deal contact damage in the form of burning.
  - Maybe an idea for a tarnished version called The Molten, who fires his hearts out as lobbed lava balls and does fire contact damage.
    - This sounds really annoying and would require him to have stompy plus a hole filler, weird but possible.
    - Any weird tear synergy, chasing enemy or enemy swarm would break him though.
- Grants **Incarnate** an extra fire ring like a multi shot item would, without the firerate downside.
- **Incarnate** will fire a bigger [Beast Blast](/docs/characters/Incarnate/items/active/Beast%20Blast/idea.md), the double thickness brimstone size.
  - It will slow him down and suck in enemy projectiles with his mouth open before launching the laser.
